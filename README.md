## Usage

### Tab1

Purpose: Find which FFP(s) can (in theory) be used to redeem award ticket on a specific carrier.

### Tab2

Purpose: Find the miles needed for a desired itinerary. Currently, it is not designed to find the 'cheapest route' between your departure and destination. It is designed to find all the redeem options for your desired route (include departure, destination, flying distance carrier and cabin for each segment.) If for some reason (most likely due to availability) that issue your trip on one ticket is not applicable, the program also searches for options with subsegments. A few examples below

### Tab3

Purpose: Compare if it is worth it to use award ticket. Tax and fees for the award ticket and cash price for the same itinerary needs to be manually input. Mile evaluation can be changed by personal preference.



### Tab4

Purpose: Find which FFP can be used to collect miles when taking cash price tickets from a certain carrier. As a frequent flyer, I would assume you have a preferred program for each alliance. By displaying family pooling and expiration policy, the main purpose for this is to help you decide for your less frequent flying family members, which program is convenient for them and you to use the collected miles.
